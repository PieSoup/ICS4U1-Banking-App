# The Epic Banking App
## How to use:
### Logging in:
To login, you first must create an account. This can be done with the sign up feature.
Next, once signed up, you can access either you chequing or savings account.

### Chequing vs. Savings:
The chequing account can be both withdrawn from and deposited to, however you cannot earn interest on the money in it.
The savings account does not allow you to withdraw from it, but does earn interest on money in it.

### Transferring money:
To transfer money, type in the amount you want to transfer and click "Transfer."
Next, type the name of the recipient of the money. **Tip: leaving this blank will allow you to transfer money between your chequing and savings account!**
Finally, click the account that the money will go into

That's pretty much all there is to using the **Epic banking app!**
